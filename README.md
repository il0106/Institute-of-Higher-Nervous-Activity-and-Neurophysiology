## Russian Academy of Sciences
# Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology
This repository is related to my work at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology. 

The main module (yet) is 'ratcontagion'. This module contains RatExperiment class that helps analyze visit data from the IntelliCage system to research behavioral contagion among rats.
### How can RatExperiment module help you?
- Transforming the data from IntelliCage to comfortable pandas format
- Processing the data slicing as you wish
- Creating static (via pyvis) and dynamic (via plotly time slider) graphs describing behavioral contagion among rats in the IntelliCage
- Analyzing the number of rat visits, time intervals between visits in various slices making histograms
- Building your own modified classes and functions 
### Where should you start?
1) Learn more about behavioral contagion
2) Read about IntelliCage and its output files
3) See the tutorial notebook with the useful examples
4) Try to import ratcontagion module with RatExperiment class and work with it

### A little bit about my role in the studies
My roles are programming, data analysis, mathematical statistics and visualisation. The main reason of my participation is my personal interest, bacause I have a possibility to work with real scientists and do some things as one of the first in the niche of these studies. Of course, these studies have helped me improve my understanding of mathematical statistics, as well as some visualization features.
