# Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology
## Purposes
This repository is related to my work at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology. The research itself focuses on behavioural contagion among rats. My roles in this work are programming, data analysis, mathematical statistics and visualisation. The main reason of my participation is my personal interest, bacause I have a possibility to deal with real scientists and do some things as one of the first in the niche of these studies. Of course, these studies have helped me improve my understanding of mathematical statistics, as well as some visualization features.
